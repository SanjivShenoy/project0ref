                    <p>A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature,
                         Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel.While she is kind, caring and friendly, Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive
                         cleanliness (classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean').
                          She is also known to talk abnormally loudly (such as in The One With The Apothecary Table) and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills
                          (such as The One On The Last Night). Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintenance. Aside from being a neat-freak, Monica can also be bossy
                          and somewhat competitive, hating to lose in competitions.</p>

                    <p>While he is smart, polite, caring, thoughtful and kind, Ross is often clumsy and socially
                         awkward - taking the characteristics of the stereotypical "loser nerd". He is sometimes
                          shown to have a good sense of humor. He is the only member of the group of friends with a doctorate
                          and, as such, can be arrogant. In most cases, his arrogance backfires or gets the best of him.
                          Despite being financially secure, Ross is notoriously cheap. He gets his hair cut at the bargain chain Super Cuts;
                          steals toiletries and other amenities from hotels and refuses to tip anyone. He is often mocked by his friends
                          about his annoying habits of correcting people's grammar and avoiding straightforward dialogue when nervous.
                          Above all Ross is a very sweet, loving and adorable guy who is always looking out for everyone's
                          best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang, despite his ego, outbursts,
                          and paranoia.</p>

                    <p>Rachel Karen Green was born to Leonard and Sandra Green, who gave her and her two sisters Jill
                        and Amy a rather spoiled upbringing. She met Monica Geller for the first time when they were
                        both six years old. They quickly became best friends, remaining exactly that from then until
                        attending the same high school. Rachel also soon met Monica's older brother, Ross, who
                        developed a crush on her which he ultimately decided to keep to himself. Rachel throughout
                        the seasons is seen as very desirable, and adds flavor to the friend's seasons. She is also
                        very kind at heart, and a really good friend.</p>

                    <p>Though Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he had a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor.
                      Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends.He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage is.
                      Because of this Chandler is normally dominated by his ballsy and forward
                        spouse, Monica and rarely ever "wins" in a fight with her, however, Chandler does have bursts of confidence. When Monica wanted to use his nest egg to pay for their big wedding he firmly put his foot down,
                        which greatly impressed Phoebe who normally points Chandler out for his effeminate nature, claiming "Money, and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with". </p>

                <div class="col-7">
                    <p>Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal,
                        complete childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards
                        still a child at heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise.
                        Phoebe also shocks some people in the story line with her frankness on occasions that
                        it catches them off guard from her usual self. This straightforwardness is a running gag
                        throughout the Friends series.Phoebe is occasionally referred to as a heavy drinker,
                        although she never demonstrates any dependence that would make her an alcoholic.
                        Phoebe becomes noticeably a little more intelligent during the last two seasons.</p>

                    <p>Joey is generally good-natured and well-meaning, but not-so-bright. He loves
                        food, women, sex, family, friends, jam, and the New York Knicks. He has a lot of
                        trouble with understanding negative criticism of his acting. Also, although he is
                        usually simple-minded, there are moments where he seems very smart. He discovers
                        Chandler and Monica slept with each other when he hears Monica lost her eyelash-curler,
                        and immediately remembers Chandler saying that the girl he slept with had lost her eyelash-curler.
                        Despite generally being ignorant in most academic fields, he purchases a single encyclopedia
                        in "The One With The Cuffs". This ends up making him knowledgeable about any topic that begins
                        with the letter "V", specifically vomit, Mount Vesuvius, volcanoes, vivisection, the vas deferens,
                        and the Vietnam War.</p>
