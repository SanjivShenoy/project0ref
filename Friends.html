                    <p>A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature,
                         Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel.While she is kind, caring and friendly, Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive
                         cleanliness (classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean').
                          She is also known to talk abnormally loudly (such as in The One With The Apothecary Table) and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills
                          (such as The One On The Last Night). Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintenance. Aside from being a neat-freak, Monica can also be bossy
                          and somewhat competitive, hating to lose in competitions.</p>
