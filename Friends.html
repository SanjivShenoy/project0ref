                    <p>A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature,
                         Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel.While she is kind, caring and friendly, Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive
                         cleanliness (classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean').
                          She is also known to talk abnormally loudly (such as in The One With The Apothecary Table) and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills
                          (such as The One On The Last Night). Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintenance. Aside from being a neat-freak, Monica can also be bossy
                          and somewhat competitive, hating to lose in competitions.</p>

                <div class="col-7">
                    <p>While he is smart, polite, caring, thoughtful and kind, Ross is often clumsy and socially
                         awkward - taking the characteristics of the stereotypical "loser nerd". He is sometimes
                          shown to have a good sense of humor. He is the only member of the group of friends with a doctorate
                          and, as such, can be arrogant. In most cases, his arrogance backfires or gets the best of him.
                          Despite being financially secure, Ross is notoriously cheap. He gets his hair cut at the bargain chain Super Cuts;
                          steals toiletries and other amenities from hotels and refuses to tip anyone. He is often mocked by his friends
                          about his annoying habits of correcting people's grammar and avoiding straightforward dialogue when nervous.
                          Above all Ross is a very sweet, loving and adorable guy who is always looking out for everyone's
                          best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang, despite his ego, outbursts,
                          and paranoia.</p>
